## Config Files

- **site_config.json** – Site-specific settings (DB credentials, API keys).  
  If wrong → site may fail to connect to DB/services.

- **common_site_config.json** – Bench-wide settings shared by all sites (Redis, ports, workers).  
  ⚠️ Putting a secret here exposes it to all sites → security risk & cross-site access.

- **Procfile** – Defines processes started by `bench start`.  
  If incorrect → required services won’t start.

- **hooks.py** – App configuration (scheduled jobs, events, permissions).  
  If misconfigured → background jobs or triggers may fail.

---

## Bench Processes (`bench start`)

- **web** – Serves HTTP requests.  
- **worker** – Runs background jobs (emails, reports, long tasks).  
- **scheduler** – Queues periodic jobs.  
- **socketio** – Enables real-time updates.

**If the worker crashes:**  
Background jobs stop running and remain queued in Redis until the worker restarts.

## Step 1 – Routing

- **/api/method/quickfix.api.get_job_summary**  
  Calls the `get_job_summary` function in `quickfix/api.py`.  
  Frappe imports the dotted path and runs the whitelisted method.

- **/api/resource/Job Card/JC-2024-0001**  
  Uses Frappe’s REST API to fetch the `Job Card` document from the database.  
  Unlike `/api/method/`, it uses built-in CRUD, not a custom function.

- **/track-job**  
  Handled by files in the `www` folder (e.g., `www/track-job.py` or `.html`).  
  Frappe auto-maps `www` files to website routes.

## Step 2 – Session & CSRF

- **X-Frappe-CSRF-Token**
  - The token comes from the user’s active session and is generated by Frappe to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
  - It is sent with POST/PUT/DELETE requests and validated on the server.
  - If omitted or invalid → the request is rejected with a CSRF validation error (HTTP 403).

- **frappe.session.data**
  - If you run frappe.session.data it should return None.
  - If your run frappe.session it will return user and csrf token.

## Step 3 – Error Visibility

- **developer_mode: 1**
  - When a Python exception occurs in a whitelisted method, the browser receives:
    - Full traceback
    - Error type and message
    - File path and line number
  - This helps developers debug issues quickly.

- **developer_mode: 0**
  - The browser receives a generic error message (e.g., "Internal Server Error").
  - Detailed traceback is hidden to prevent exposing sensitive information.
  - This is important for production to protect system details and security.

- **Where production errors go**
  - Errors are logged in:
    - `frappe.log_error()` logs
    - Error Log DocType in the database
    - Bench/server log files (`logs/` directory)

## Step 4 – Permission Check Location

 1. `frappe.get_doc("Job Card", name)`

   * Called without `ignore_permissions=True`, Frappe checks document permissions.
   * It verifies whether the current user can access the **Job Card**.

 2. Unassigned QF Technician access

   * If an unassigned **QF Technician** attempts access:

   * **PermissionError** is raised.
   * Browser receives **HTTP 403 Forbidden**.
   * Access is denied.

 3. Where the request stops

   * Request stops at Frappe’s **Document permission layer**.
   * Checks include roles, user permissions, assignments, and sharing rules.
   * If denied, execution halts at `frappe.get_doc()`.


## Part A – Table Naming (Bench Console)

### 1. Tables matching `%Job%`

**Command**

```sql id="5c9d2f"
frappe.db.sql("SHOW TABLES LIKE '%Job%'")
```
**Output**

tabJob Card
tabScheduled Job Log
tabScheduled Job Type

**Explanation**

* Frappe stores each **DocType** as a table prefixed with `tab`.
* Format: `tab<DocType Name>`
* Example: `Job Card` → `tabJob Card`

---

### 2. Structure of `tabJob Card`

**Command**

```sql id="8b2d5a"
frappe.db.sql("DESCRIBE `tabJob Card`", as_dict=True)
```

### 3. Recognised columns

Common system fields:

* `name` – Primary key
* `creation` – Created timestamp
* `modified` – Last modified time
* `owner` – Document creator
* `docstatus` – Draft/Submitted/Cancelled status

These fields are automatically added by Frappe to manage documents.

## Part D – DocStatus Transitions

### 1. DocStatus values

* **0 – Draft** 
* **1 – Submitted** 
* **2 – Cancelled** 

### 2. Submitted & Cancelled behavior

* `doc.save()` on **Submitted** →  Not allowed (except fields with *Allow on Submit*).
* `doc.submit()` on **Cancelled** →  Not allowed. Must **Amend → Submit** to keep audit trail.


### 3. "Document has been modified after you opened it"

Occurs when:

* Another user/script updated the document.
* The `modified` timestamp changed.

**Purpose:** Prevents overwriting newer changes.

## Part E – Dangerous Patterns (Fix)

###  Issues

1. **`self.save()` inside `validate()`**

   * Causes recursion and breaks the document lifecycle.
   * `validate()` already runs during save.

2. **Unsafe update to another DocType**

   * Directly modifying Spare Part stock can cause data inconsistency.
   * No protection against concurrent updates.


###  Corrected approach

* Calculate totals inside `validate()` without calling `save()`.
* Update related documents within the same transaction so changes stay consistent.
* Ensure updates roll back automatically if the main document fails.


# Child Table Internals

## Auto-set Columns on Child Rows
When a row is added to `Job Card.parts_used` and saved, Frappe automatically sets:

- **parent** – Parent document name (Job Card ID)
- **parenttype** – Parent DocType ("Job Card")
- **parentfield** – Child table fieldname ("parts_used")
- **idx** – Row order in the table

---

## Child Table DB Name
The database table for **Part Usage Entry** DocType is:

tabPart Usage Entry

Frappe adds the `tab` prefix to all DocType tables.

---

## idx Behavior After Deletion
If the row at `idx = 2` is deleted and the document is saved:

- Remaining rows are automatically reordered.
- `idx` values are reset sequentially starting from 1.
- No gaps are left in row numbering.
